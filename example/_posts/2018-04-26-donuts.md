As a lover of donuts, I’ve always feared making them (mostly because I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to yeast and rolling dough). This recipe wasn’t so bad! I think the trickiest part was keeping the oil at a consistent temperature and finding the right time to flip each donut to get that perfect golden color.
